1. Download [`Release.zip`](https://github.com/PrincessRTFM/CowtasticCafeEasyMode/releases/latest/download/Release.zip) (unless you need to debug something) from [the latest build](https://github.com/PrincessRTFM/CowtasticCafeEasyMode/releases/latest).
2. Unzip it into the same folder as `Cowtastic Cafe.exe` - you should end up with `winhttp.dll`, `doorstop_config.ini`, and a folder named `EasyMode`, all in the same directory as the game's own executable file.
3. Run `Cowtastic Cafe.exe` as you would normally.

If you encounter a problem, please [open a report on the tracker](https://github.com/PrincessRTFM/CowtasticCafeEasyMode/issues/new) to let me know.
